## Introduction

This is a code repository for my project. In this project, I'm trying to build a Modern UI/UX Website

- Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
- Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
- From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices
- Deploy my website on free web hosting sites.
